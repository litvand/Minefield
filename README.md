# Minefield

This is a game where a floating blue balloon has to escape from red mines. The mines go directly towards the balloon and explode when they bump into each other. In "play.py", you can change whether the player controls the mines or the balloon or both (local multiplayer), where mines spawn and how the balloon behaves.

Requires pyglet 1.5.27 (`pip3 install pyglet==1.5.27`).

Press `P` to unpause at the start of the game. You can pause again later with `P`.

Use `WASD` to move around.
